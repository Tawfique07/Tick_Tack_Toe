# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Java AWT)

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). The game is designed for two players, where each player takes turns marking a square in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player mode.
- 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Java AWT.
- Simple and intuitive gameplay.

## Installation and Setup

To run this game, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-java.git
cd tic-tac-toe-java
```

### Compile and Run

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the Java files using the following command:

```bash
javac TicTacToe.java
```

4. Run the program:

```

## How to Play

1. The game opens with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns by clicking on the empty cells to place their symbol (`X` or `O`).
3. The first player to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher.
- Basic understanding of Java AWT.
