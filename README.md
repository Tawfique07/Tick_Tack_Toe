# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Java AWT)

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). The game is designed for two players, where each player takes turns marking a square in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player mode.
- 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Java AWT.
- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
